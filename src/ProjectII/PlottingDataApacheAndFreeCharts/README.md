#Apache and JFree Charts
The TestingChart and TestingSmoother classes aren't part of
the final product, but I left them in order to show more of the

is 99% copied and pasted from:
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jfreechart/jfreechart_line_chart.htm

TestingSmoother however was my creation to test if my method would work.
