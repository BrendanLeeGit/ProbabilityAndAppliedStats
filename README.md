# ProbabilityAndAppliedStats

ProjectII

I generally recommend you view the reports first, mainly because I included a small instructions section for the personal salter and smoother, as well as the JFreeCharts and ApacheCommons implementation.

Each of the reports as well as the formula sheet is bunched together in the Formula Sheet and Reports directory.

CSVStuff contains the personal plotter and smoother.
OctaveStuff contains the scripts as well as the resulting CSV files.
PlottingDataApacheAndFreeCharts contains the .java files for of course the 
ApacheCommons and JFreecharts program, though it doesn't contain the output of the program.
And StatsLibrary naturally contains the StatsLibrary with the majority of methods from ProjectI removed. 



ProjectI

.idea can be mostly ignored since I didn't end up using any complicated or outside modules or anything crazy.
src has the different directories for all of the main programming assignments.
Additionally, ProjectI.OtherFiles will contain non-programming work such as the Histogram sheets.

ProjectI.SameBirthday is the program that calculates the chance of having a repeated birthday in a room full of people.
ProjectI.SetOperationsAndStatsLibrary contains the library for every Statistics method and function we've had to code.
ProjectI.ThreeDoors is the program that simulates the Monte Carlo problem with the game show.

Beginning of Semester Histograms is the excel work we did in the very first classes.
Histograms is for the Binomial and Geometric distribution problems we solved and graphed.
output.csv is the CSV file created and read by ProjectII.CSVStuff. 
GitHub report is the one page essay on git workflow.

Additionally, you may see that GameUnmaker is also a contributor for some of the code. 
That's my other account. I had a few issues in the beginning with using the correct account to push my changes.
