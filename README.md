Homework and Projects
I'll use this README to clarify what each file is for, as well as the weird contributor situation.

.idea can be mostly ignored since I didn't end up using any complicated or outside modules or anything crazy.
src has the different directories for all of the main programming assignments.

CSVStuff is for the CSV creation and reading program.
SameBirthday is the program that calculates the chance of having a repeated birthday in a room full of people.
SetOperationsAndStatsLibrary contains the library for every Statistics method and function we've had to code.
ThreeDoors is the program that simulates the Monte Carlo problem with the game show.

Beginning of Semester Histograms is the excel work we did in the very first classes.
Histograms is for the Binomial and Geometric distribution problems we solved and graphed.
output.csv is the CSV file created and read by CSVStuff. 
GitHub report is the one page essay on git workflow.

Additionally, you may see that GameUnmaker is also a contributor for some of the code. 
That's my other account. I had a few issues in the beginning with using the correct account to push my changes.
